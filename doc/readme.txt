Intro
-----
SolidCoin is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that is
completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or trusted
parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly
with each other, with the help of a P2P network to check for double-spending.


Setup
-----
Unpack the files into a directory and run solidcoin.exe.

If you have Microsoft Security Essentials, you need to add solidcoin.exe to its
"Excluded processes" list.  Microsoft Security Essentials->Settings tab,
select Excluded processes, press Add, select solidcoin.exe, OK, Save changes.

The software automatically finds other nodes to connect to.  You can
enable Universal Plug and Play using a menu entry or set your firewall
to forward port 8333 (TCP) to your computer so you can receive
incoming connections.  SolidCoin work without incoming connections,
but allowing incoming connections helps the SolidCoin network.
