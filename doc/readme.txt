Setup
-----
Unpack the files into a directory and run solidcoin.exe.

If you have Microsoft Security Essentials, you need to add solidcoin.exe to its
"Excluded processes" list.  Microsoft Security Essentials->Settings tab,
select Excluded processes, press Add, select solidcoin.exe, OK, Save changes.

The software automatically finds other nodes to connect to.  You can
enable Universal Plug and Play using a menu entry or set your firewall
to forward port 8333 (TCP) to your computer so you can receive
incoming connections.  SolidCoin work without incoming connections,
but allowing incoming connections helps the SolidCoin network.
